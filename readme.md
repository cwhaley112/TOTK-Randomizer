### What's randomized
- Enemies
- Weapons (excludes those found in chests)
	- melee weapon attachments
	- enemy arrow attachments

### Randomization Options
- **Normal mode:** total numbers of enemies/weapons/etc. are unchanged. For example, there is still only 1 Ganondorf, but his location could be anywhere.
- **Chaos mode:** all enemies/weapons are equally likely. There will be ~equal numbers of Bokoblins, Lynels, and Ganondorfs :)

### Usage
