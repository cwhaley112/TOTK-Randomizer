enemy randomization does not include:
* dragons (like faroh)
* moldugas (Enemy_Sandworm); causes the game to crash when burrowing in certain areas (thoroughly tested)
* evermeans (enemy_treant) due to crashes (possibly due to rails (paths) or burrowing anims. not fully tested)
* kohga robot cause he's fucking invincible (Enemy_Kohga_GolemRider, Enemy_Kohga_Golem)
* Enemy_Giant_Bone_AllDay (prefer to use regular stalnox)
